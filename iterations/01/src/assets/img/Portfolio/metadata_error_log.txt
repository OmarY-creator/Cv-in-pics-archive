A class for storing and manipulating classification probabilities.

    This class extends BaseTensor and provides methods for accessing and manipulating classification probabilities,
    including top-1 and top-5 predictions.

    Attributes:
        data (torch.Tensor | np.ndarray): The raw tensor or array containing classification probabilities.
        orig_shape (tuple | None): The original image shape as (height, width). Not used in this class.
        top1 (int): Index of the class with the highest probability.
        top5 (list[int]): Indices of the top 5 classes by probability.
        top1conf (torch.Tensor | np.ndarray): Confidence score of the top 1 class.
        top5conf (torch.Tensor | np.ndarray): Confidence scores of the top 5 classes.

    Methods:
        cpu: Return a copy of the probabilities tensor on CPU memory.
        numpy: Return a copy of the probabilities tensor as a numpy array.
        cuda: Return a copy of the probabilities tensor on GPU memory.
        to: Return a copy of the probabilities tensor with specified device and dtype.

    Examples:
        >>> probs = torch.tensor([0.1, 0.3, 0.6])
